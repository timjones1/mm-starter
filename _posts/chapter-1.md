This course on Coursera was my first introduction to Machine Learning way back in 2016, Andrew Ng is an inspirational teacher and his now famous course covers the basics of machine learning using Octave or Matlab. I chose to complete the course in Matlab but Andrew really teaches the foundations of machine learning with this course and the tools used are less important than the ideas put forward of which there are many, Andrew strives to give the student an "intuition" of how the main machine learning algorithms work.

some of the topics covered on the course are:

 * Linear Regression 
 * Logistic Regression
 * Regularization
 * Neural Networks
 * Advice for Applied Machine Learning
 * Machine Learning System Design
 * Support Vector Machines
 * Unsupervised Learning
 
I found the assignments to be really interesting and Andrew's enthusiastic teaching style really kickstarted my interest in the field along with so many others. I would totally recommend this course to people new to machine learning.
